### Overview
Party with Professor PEMDAS is a problem-solving game. Mathematical expressions will appear on the game board and to the user needs correctly to solve each expression using the mathematical principles of PEMDAS (also known as the Order of Operations).

PEMDAS, also written as PE[MD][AS], is an acronym that stands for (P)arentheses, (E)xponents, [(M)ultiplication and (D)ivision], [(A)ddition and (S)ubtraction]. It lists the order in which mathematical operations should be solved in any given expression.

I currently hold a degree in Mathematical Sciences (Applied Mathematics). I was also a Math teacher for some time. During my time as a Math teacher, I noticed that most of the time, students had issues with basic principles, such as PEMDAS. I created this game as a practice tool for those who struggle with such principles.

### Game Rules
* Accurately calculate the expressions that will show up on the page, using PEMDAS (Order of operations), within the time given.
* Expressions start as 3 ramdomly generated numbers with 2 operations.
* Computer wins a point if you don't enter the answer within the time given.
* Get 1 correct, your count goes up by 1. Get it incorrect, the computer wins and it's count goes up by 1.
* You get less time with each question answered correctly.
* Get 5 correct, the experssions become harder (4 randomly generated numbers with 3 operations).
* Get 10 correct, game over; you win the game.
* If the computer gets to 10, game over; you lose the game.

### User Stories
* Player will click "Start" button.
* A random expression will appear onscreen with randomly generated numbers (-12 to 12).
* Player has to input answers into input fields and click "Submit" button to submit answer.
* Player has to click "Next" button for a new expression to appear on screen and a new timer to start.
* Player can click "Reset" button to reset game.
